Have you ever wondered how to combine multiple Raspberry Pi boards into one single super computer. In this post I will guide you step by step to accomplish the above goal.

## Requirements
	1. One or more Raspberry Pi boards.
	2. Raspbian OS or any other Linux distribution of your choice).

## Letâ€™s get started

First of all, you need to write a Raspbian OS image on **micro-SD** card, and an image writer application. To do so follow these steps:

- Plug in the micro-SD into your computer.
- Lunch Raspberry Pi Image.
- Click on `Choose OS` then navigate to `Raspberry Pi OS Other` select the desired operating system from the menu (in our case Raspberry Pi OS light).
- Select the available storage device, which is our micro-SD.
- You may want to tweak the configuration of the boot variables, via the settings button.
- Once you have done, click the **write** button.
- After completion, go to the micro-SD directory and search for file called `cmdline.txt`, then open it for editing.
- Jump to the end of the line and append the following:
`cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory ip=<your ip address>::<gateway>:<subnet mask>:<hostname>:eth0:off`, then save and close.
- Then search for a file labeled `config.txt`, and open it.
- Scroll to the bottom of the file and append the following:
`arm_64bit=1`, then save and close.
- Create a new file called `ssh`, to enable the secure shell connection.
`$ touch ssh`
- Unplug the micro-SD from your computer, and plug it back to the Raspberry Pi adapter, then connect your Ethernet, the power the board.
- Wait couple seconds, until the boot process finishes, check for connectivity by typing this command:
```
$ ping -c5 x.x.x.x
```
- Woo-hoo! You are almost done, now it is time to connect to our lovely Pi via secure shell, type the following command:
```
$ ssh username@ip address
```
Then accept the RSA footprint for the first time, then type the default password `raspberry`
- Elevate your credential to root, `sudo -i`, then type the password.
 
 ### Installing kubernitese.
 
Now we will install kubernatese, it is a container orchestration program that will help us in this post.

So let's get started

- Install kubernatese via:
```
$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | k3s_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" sh -s- 
```

### Adding some nodes to obay the master.
Now we will get the status of our raspberrys and  add multiple raspberry pies to serve our master machine.

- Get the status of the raspberry pies via:
```
$ kubectl get nodes
```

> the meaning of node in our situation is our raspberry pies.

_Repeat the steps above if you have multiple raspberry pies in defrent terminals for each pi board._

- To add a raspberry pi to serve, we need the master token via:
```
cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node_token
```
- Now to regester our pi boards use the command bellow
```
$ curl -sfL - https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN="<your master token>" K3S_URL="https://<your master ip>:6443 K3S_NODE_NAME="<servername> sh -"
```
### Instaling rancher (optional but recomended).
In this section se will install rancher for visualized configuration.

- First you need a virtual machine appart from the pi boards you have, so intialise a vertual inviroment via any virtual machine programm (_recomended softwere: ubentu 18.04 4GB_).

- Use the scure shell via terminal to log to the vertual machine, then elevate your credential to root.
- So now you need to make two directoris vie the command bellow:
```
$ mkdir /etc/rancher
$ mkdir /etc/rancher/rke2
```
- Switch to the directory rke2 and make a file:
```
$ nano config.yaml
```
- Append to the file the following:
```
1. token: <personal token>
2. tls-san:
3.   - <ip of the server you are currently in>
```
- Now, you will install rancher via the following command:
```
$ curl -sfL https://get.rancher.io | sh -
```

- You will enable the rancher service via:
```
$ systemctl enable rancherd-server.service
```

- Enter the following command to start the srvice:
```
$ systemctl start rancherd-server.service
```

- So now, you will monitor what is happening via the following command:
```
$ jurnalctl -eu rancherd-service -f
```
> If you want to stop monitoring or any process press `ctrl + C `

- You will reset the password of rancher, so you need the default username and password with the following command:
```
$ rancherd reset-admin
```

- Access the rancher by taking the ip given by the last command into any search engine.
- Enter the default username and password.
- When the next page showes, eset the password.
- Before clicking continue make sure you select the first option bellow the reset panel, so you can edit your cluster.
- Agree on terms and conditions, then click continue.
- Then when the new window pop-up save the ip by clicking `save`.
